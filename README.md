# 7guis
Trying my own hand at the challenge posed at https://eugenkiss.github.io/7guis

- purecss: very small, beautiful enough CSS asset
- typescript: Just enough type checking to have a good IDE experience and automatic documentation
- parcel: makes typescript integration look easy
- lit-html: non-framework to render DOM effeciently enough to support a functional programming style for rendering
